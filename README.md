## ðŸ‘‰ Get Started
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Update your `.env` file with values for each environment variable
```
API_KEY=AIzaSyBkkFF0XhNZeWuDmOfEhsgdfX1VBG7WTas
etc ...
```
Install the Netlify CLI
```
npm install netlify-cli -g
```
Run the development server
```
netlify dev
```
When the above command completes you'll be able to view your website at `http://localhost:8888`

_Note: You can run just the front-end with `npm run start`, but `netlify dev` also handles running your API endpoints (located in the `/api` directory)._

<summary><b>Styles</b></summary>
<p>
  You can edit Bootstrap SASS variables in the global stylesheet located at <code><a href="src/styles/global.scss">src/styles/global.scss</a></code>. Variables allow you to control global styles (like colors and fonts), as well as element specific styles (like button padding). Before overriding Bootstrap elements with custom style check the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap docs</a> to see if you can do what need by tweaking a SASS variable.
</p>
<p>
  Custom styles are located in their related component's directory. For example, if any custom style is applied to the Navbar component you'll find it in <code>src/components/Navbar.scss</code>. We ensure custom styles are scoped to their component by prepending the classname with the component name (such as <code>.Navbar__brand</code>). This ensures styles never affect elements in other components. If styles need to be re-used in multiple components consider creating a new component that encapsulates that style and structure and using that component in multiple places.

<summary><b>Routing</b></summary>
<p>
  This project uses <a target="_blank" href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start">React Router</a> and includes a convenient <code>useRouter</code> hook (located in <code><a href="src/util/router.js">src/util/router.js</a></code>) that wraps React Router and gives all the route methods and data you need.

```js
import { Link, useRouter } from './../util/router.js';

function MyComponent(){
  // Get the router object
  const router = useRouter();

  // Get value from query string (?postId=123) or route param (/:postId)
  console.log(router.query.postId);

  // Get current pathname
  console.log(router.pathname)

  // Navigate with the <Link> component or with router.push()
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      <button onClick={(e) => router.push('/about')}>About</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
